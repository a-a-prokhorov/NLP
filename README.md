# NLP

Plan:
### Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
C1_w1: Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

    Preprocessing of the raw text (tweets) : Tokenizing the string, Lowercasing, Removing stop words and punctuation, Stemming;

    Building and visualizing word frequencies;

    Visualizing tweets and the pretrained logistic regression model;

    Training logistic regression model with gradient descent


C1_w2: Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

    Visualizing Naive Bayes, Calculate the likelihoods for each tweet, Using Confidence Ellipses to interpret Naive Bayes

    Training of the model using Naive Bayes


C1_w3: Vector Space Models, Cosine Similarity, PCA Algorithm

    Linear algebra on word embeddings

    PCA as a strategy for dimensionality reduction


C1_w4: Machine Translation

    K-nearest neighbors

    Hash tables

    Searching documents and Simple Model for Word Translation
    
### Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
C2_w1: Autocorrect and Minimum Edit Distance

    Minimum edit distance algorithm (Dynamic Programming)
